<h2>About</h2>  

 Hi, I'm Rasheed and welcome to my data analyst portfolio! I am currently pursing my master's in Industrial/Organizational Psychology to use analytics to improve the employee experience and peformance through data - driven HR strategy. 

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics. The projects will typically focus on HR and Business Analytics, with occasional research projects.
